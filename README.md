Hello friends in this video I have made a small machine to make spring coil for antenna. 

In this project I have used two stepper motors and a button to start machine. 

and some 20x20 alu. extrusion for making frame of the machine.

This machine make spiral spring coil from thin wire.

I have used two stepper motor in this project One to set the length of spring coil

and one will make the turns of wire along the length of spring coil 

In general, antennas may operate in three different modes: traveling wave, fast wave, and leaky wave. Spiral antennas use all three.

The traveling wave, formed on spiral arms, allows for broadband performance. Fast wave is due to mutual coupling phenomenon occurring between arms of spiral. Leaky wave “leaks” the energy during propagation through the spiral arms to produce radiation.

Ring theory (band theory) explains the working principle of spiral antenna. The theory states that spiral antenna radiate from an active region where the circumference of the spiral equals the wavelength.

I have used arduino nano as brain for this machine and used a custom made PCB which I have oreder from [JLCPCB.com](https://jlcpcb.com/IAT)
