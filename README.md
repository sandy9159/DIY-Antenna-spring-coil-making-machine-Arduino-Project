Hello friends in this video I have made a small machine to make spring coil for antenna. 

In this project I have used two stepper motors and a button to start machine. 

and some 20x20 alu. extrusion for making frame of the machine.

This machine make spiral spring coil from thin wire.

I have used two stepper motor in this project One to set the length of spring coil

and one will make the turns of wire along the length of spring coil 

In general, antennas may operate in three different modes: traveling wave, fast wave, and leaky wave. Spiral antennas use all three.

The traveling wave, formed on spiral arms, allows for broadband performance. Fast wave is due to mutual coupling phenomenon occurring between arms of spiral. Leaky wave “leaks” the energy during propagation through the spiral arms to produce radiation.

Ring theory (band theory) explains the working principle of spiral antenna. The theory states that spiral antenna radiate from an active region where the circumference of the spiral equals the wavelength.

I have used arduino nano as brain for this machine and used a custom made PCB which I have oreder from [JLCPCB.com](https://jlcpcb.com/IAT)

I have used 20 x 20 Alu. profile for the frame construction of the machine

aluminum extrusion are the best option to build such frame by using T nuts we can place most of the components on it.

I have also placed 4 rubber pads at the bottom of the frame for better vibration cancellation.

I have mounted both stepper motors on a 3D printed bracket

this bracket then installed on Aluminium frame, for sliding mechanism I have used 8mm smooth rod

and SK8 8mm shaft holder and 8mm linear bearings

Making such projects without PCB is night mare yes trust me
you cannot get wanted result and professional touch in your project if you ignore PCB
So some days back I have developed my Multipurpose PCB.
This PCB is used to build wide range of arduino projects 

followings are the some features of PCB

1. Wide range of power input 9V to 24V DC
2. Cross polarity protection
3. DC motor voltage selection 9V or 12 V DC
4. Servo motor voltage selection 5V or 9V DC
5. Manual microstepping setting for stepper motor
6. Power indication LED
7. L298N IC for heavier DC motor
8. ON board 5V and 9V regulator no need to arrange different power sources
9. Header pins and screw terminals for easy connections

List of the Components you can connect to the PCB

1. 2 DC motor ( 9V to 24V DC)
2. 2 Potentiometer
3. 2 Servo motors ( 5V to 9V DC)
4. 1 Serial device (BT module, HMI, Communication module, RX, TX)
5. 1 Encoder (2 interrupt pin & 1 PB pin)
6. 1 I2C device (SCL/SDA Device, display, MPU6050 etc)
7. 2 Stepper motors
